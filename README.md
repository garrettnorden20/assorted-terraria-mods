# Assorted Terraria Mods

Back in 2021, I made quite a few different mods for Terraria. I didn't really play with any or publish them, or even make a cohesive actual mod of them, but each individual part was small enough that I didn't get bored with it. I am sure it is not very balanced, and I did not take netcode into account whatsoever. Regardless, its fun to see where I was at. 

I had made an Excel sheet to track my progress, [right here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pXw0Ks3CAeal7zSKVwVdVIxQTGNMANM8flUOSNe4rWk/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I don't really remember what my acronyms mean in it.
